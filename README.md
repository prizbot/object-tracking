This project focuses on moving object detection and tracking using OpenCV, a widely-used computer vision library. The primary goal is to accurately identify and track moving objects in real-time or recorded video footage under various environmental conditions. By utilizing classical computer vision techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models for static background modeling and optical-flow-based methods, the project effectively detects and tracks objects without the need for deep learning techniques. The application of this technology can be particularly useful in industrial settings for monitoring conveyor belts, ensuring quality control, and improving process efficiency. The implementation includes Python OpenCV (cv2) for video processing, a custom tracker module, and background subtraction for object detection. The project demonstrates object tracking with a stable camera position, highlighting OpenCV's capabilities in handling real-time object detection and tracking. The provided code includes the main detection and tracking logic, as well as a custom Euclidean distance tracker to maintain object identities across frames. This project serves as a practical example of how computer vision can be applied to solve real-world problems in various domains.
